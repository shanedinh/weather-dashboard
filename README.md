# Weather Dashboard

## Description
A weather dashboard where you can search by city. Shows the weather for the current day as well as the forecast for the next 5 days.

## Issues / Bugs
* City history doesn't show under search button on live website but shows when testing out of VS Code.
* Had issues with getting main weather card to update when a new location was searched.
* Had issues with getting local storage to persist when page was refreshed, as well as getting new location to save to local storage after first one.
